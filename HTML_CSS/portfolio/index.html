                <h5>Chaat</h5>
                Synonymous with Delhi street food vendors, chaat is one of India’s most delicious savoury snacks. The name derives from three Hindi words meaning ‘a delicacy,’ ‘licking one’s fingers’ and ‘to devour with relish’ and this dish truly does live up to its
                heritage. Although there’s now a plethora of different varieties, the original chaat is a wonderful combination of diced potato pieces, crispy fried bread and chickpeas garnished with fresh coriander leaves, yoghurt and dried ginger and
                tamarind sauce.

                Most foodies will have heard of or tasted dal, but there’s nothing quite like tasting the original dish in the country where it originated from. Dal is the Hindi word for lentils, and this soup-like delicacy is made by stewing small black lentils for
                hours on end. Whilst there are many different varieties of this lentil dish, dal makhani is in a league of its own. It’s considered the best of the best, and is reserved for big events like wedding celebrations. With makhani meaning ‘buttery’
                in Hindi, there’s no prizes for guessing how rich and creamy this Indian classic tastes. Head to Punjab, in India’s north, to taste the real deal.

                Originating in the traditionally vegetarian state of Maharashtra, vada pav is as close as Indian cuisine gets to veggie burgers. One for carb lovers, vada pav consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed neatly inside a small bun. The finger food delicacy
                is generally accompanied by a couple of chutneys and a green chilli, to appeal to the spice loving palettes of Indians up and down the country. Also called a Bombay burger, these mini potato buns can be found in street food stalls across
                the city of Mumbai.

                <h5>Stuffed paratha</h5>
                Punjab’s foodie heritage doesn’t stop at dal makhani. Often eaten at the start of the day, stuffed parathas are seen as the breakfast of champions in northern India. The word paratha derives from the Sanskrit word atta meaning ‘layers of cooked dough,’
                and this dish lives up to its moniker. After leaving the dough (or atta) to rest overnight, parathas are made by cooking the dough on a tava before shallow frying. The most common way to eat parathas is to stuff them with a filling of
                your choosing. Parathas can be stuffed with any number of fillings, but some of our favourites are aloo paratha (stuffed with potatoes) and methi paratha (stuffed with fenugreek).

                Hailed as the regional dish of northwest India, the Gujarati delicacy dhokla is a savoury vegetarian snack made of rice and split chickpeas. It’s tastier than it sounds – Gujaratis eat it for breakfast or lunch, and sometimes even as a snack or side dish.
                Another dish that takes hours of preparation, dhokla involves soaking the rice and split chickpeas in equal quantities overnight. Then, chilli, coriander, ginger and baking soda are added to add spice to the dish, and help it rise into
                delicious bite size morsels. Usually served alongside deep fried chilli and coriander chutney, this Gujarati delicacy is wonderfully moreish

                <h5>Barfi</h5>
                We’ve cheated a little bit here, as the term barfi can be used to describe any number of Indian sweets. The most traditional type though is milk barfi. Predictably, these milk-based sweets are made from milk powder, condensed milk, ghee and cardamom powder.
                Barfi is not going to help anyone reach their health-conscious goals, but these indulgent fragrant desserts are sure to bring a smile to the face of anyone who tries them. These sweets are traditionally gifted as good luck offerings at
                occasions like wedding ceremonies, but there’s nothing to say you can’t pop down to the sweet shop to buy one to accompany your afternoon chai.

                Pani puri, or gol guppa, or fuchka are thought to originate from the northern state of Bihar. A perfect streetside snack, pani puri are hollow deep fried balls made of semolina or wheat. They’re served alongside spicy potatoes, chickpeas and a spicy tamarind
                water. Eating pani puri is an experience in itself, as you traditionally crack open the top of the deep fried shell with a spoon before filling it with the delicious accompaniments. Most Indians eat each pani puri with one swift bite,
                to save any of the filling spilling out of the delicate case. This infamous street snack unites most of the country – everyone from local college students to city businessmen can be found devouring them.

                Popular across South India, idli are often thought of as the breakfast versions of dosa. Eaten at the start of the day, idli are a type of light savoury rice cake. Made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils and rice, these rice cakes
                are dangerously easy to eat. Since idli are pretty bland on their own, these mini pancake-like breakfast staples are served alongside sambar, coconut based chutneys, or spicy fish curries. Over the years, idli has evolved into many different
                varieties, so you’re sure to find one that satisfies your taste buds.

                India’s most famous export, masala chai can be found being sold by everywhere from high end restaurants to chaiwallas at train stations. While there’s many different diluted versions of this classic Indian tea around the globe, the real deal can only
                be found in India. Authentic masala chai is made by brewing black tea on the stove with a mixture of aromatic spices and herbs. Traditionally, the spices used are green cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, ground cloves and black pepper, creating
                a wonderful aromatic cup of tea. There’s nothing quite like sipping a hot cup of authentic masala chai first thing in the morning!
